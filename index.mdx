- **Investigate faster** — Query all your systems from a single conversation
- **Catch what you'd miss** — Automatic correlation surfaces hidden connections
- **Scale your team** — Hiro handles the tedious work while humans make decisions
- **Stay in control** — Every high-impact action requires your approval
