|-------------|-------|---------|-------|
| **Okta** | Users, groups, apps, logs, policies | Suspend, clear sessions, manage users/groups/apps | Requires admin role + OAuth scopes |
| **AWS** | CloudTrail, IAM analysis | Terminate EC2, delete IAM users/keys, WAF blocking | Uses IAM AssumeRole |
| **CrowdStrike** | Detections, host info | Contain/uncontain hosts, update alerts | Auto-ingests detections |
| **Datadog** | Log search, correlation | None (read-only) | Supports all Datadog sites |
| **GitHub** | Branch protection, audit logs | Enable branch protection only | Audit logs require Enterprise Cloud |
| **Google Workspace** | Users, groups, devices, reports | None (read-only) | All scopes are read-only |
| **Slack** | User info | Reset sessions (Enterprise only), send alerts | Primarily for alerts and bot |

## Connecting Integrations

All integrations are managed from [**Settings > Integrations**](https://app.hiro.is/settings/integrations).

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Settings">
    Click **Settings** in the left sidebar, then select **Integrations**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select an integration">
    Find the integration you want to connect and click **Connect**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Authorize access">
    Follow the specific setup flow for that integration (OAuth, API credentials, etc.).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify connection">
    Hiro will test the connection and show a success message.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Recommended Order

For the best experience, connect integrations in this order:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Okta (or Google Workspace)">
    **Identity first.** Most investigations involve users, so start with your identity provider.
  </Step>
  <Step title="AWS">
    **Cloud infrastructure.** CloudTrail provides rich API logs that Hiro correlates with identity data.
  </Step>
  <Step title="CrowdStrike">
    **Endpoint detection.** Hiro automatically ingests detections and correlates with identity and cloud.
  </Step>
  <Step title="GitHub">
    **Source code security.** Analyze branch protection and audit repository access.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Slack">
    **Alerts and bot.** Receive security alerts and interact with Hiro from Slack.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Managing Integrations

### View Status

Go to [**Settings > Integrations**](https://app.hiro.is/settings/integrations) to see all connected integrations and their status:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Connected** | Working normally |
| **Error** | Connection issue—click for details |
| **Expired** | Credentials need refresh |

### Disconnect

To remove an integration:
1. Go to [**Settings > Integrations**](https://app.hiro.is/settings/integrations)
2. Click on the integration
3. Click **Disconnect**

<Warning>
Disconnecting an integration immediately revokes Hiro's access. Active investigations using that integration will show errors.
