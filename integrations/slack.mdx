## Features

### Security Alerts

When detections occur, Hiro sends formatted alerts to your configured channel:

- Detection title and severity
- Key details and indicators
- Link to view in Hiro dashboard

To configure:
1. Go to [**Settings > Integrations**](https://app.hiro.is/settings/integrations)
2. Select a channel from the dropdown
3. Click **Save**

### Interactive Bot

Your team can interact with Hiro directly in Slack:

**@mention in a channel:**
```
@Hiro what happened with john@company.com in the last hour?
```

**Direct message:**
```
Show me failed logins from the last 24 hours
```

Hiro responds using the same investigation capabilities as the web interface—querying your connected integrations and providing actionable findings.

### Session Reset (Enterprise Grid Only)

With Enterprise Grid, Hiro can force users to re-authenticate:

```
PROPOSED ACTION: Reset Slack Session
────────────────────────────────────
User: john@company.com (U1234567890)
Reason: Account compromise suspected
Effect: User will be logged out of Slack on all devices

[Approve]  [Reject]
```

<Info>
Session reset requires the `admin.users:write` scope, which is only available on Slack Enterprise Grid plans.
</Info>

## How the Bot Works

When you @mention Hiro or send a DM:

1. Slack sends the message to Hiro
2. Hiro's AI agent processes your question
3. The agent queries your connected integrations (Okta, AWS, etc.)
4. Findings stream back to Slack in real-time
5. If actions are needed, they're proposed in the Hiro dashboard

The bot has access to all the same query tools as the web interface, but remediation actions still require approval through the dashboard.

## Example Interactions

**Check user activity:**
```
@Hiro what has jane@company.com done in Okta today?
```

**Investigate an IP:**
```
@Hiro show me all activity from IP 185.220.101.1
```

**Quick status check:**
```
@Hiro is john@company.com's account suspended?
```

## Troubleshooting

### Bot not responding

- Verify the integration is connected in [**Settings > Integrations**](https://app.hiro.is/settings/integrations)
- Check that you're @mentioning the bot correctly
- Try sending a direct message to the bot instead

### Alerts not appearing

- Verify a notification channel is selected
- Check that the bot has been added to the channel
- Try sending a test notification from Settings

### "Missing scope" error

The connected Slack app may be missing required permissions. Disconnect and reconnect the integration.
