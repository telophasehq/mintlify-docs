The GitHub integration provides visibility into repository security posture and branch protection status.

## Capabilities

### Query Tools

| Tool | What It Does |
|------|--------------|
| **Check branch protection** | Analyze protection status across all accessible repos |
| **Get repo protection** | Get detailed protection rules for a specific repo/branch |
| **Query audit log** | Search audit events by username, IP, action (Enterprise Cloud only) |
| **Query security events** | Filter for security-relevant actions (branch protection changes, access changes, token creation) |

### Action Tools

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Enable branch protection | Enable basic branch protection (require PR reviews, prevent force push) |

### What Hiro Cannot Do

- Revoke personal access tokens
- Remove collaborators
- Delete repositories
- Manage webhooks or deploy keys
- Fine-grained permission management

<Info>
The GitHub integration is primarily read-focused for security posture analysis.

## Setup

### Connection Method

Hiro connects via a **GitHub App**, not OAuth or personal access tokens.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start connection">
    In Hiro, go to [**Settings > Integrations**](https://app.hiro.is/settings/integrations) and click **Connect to GitHub**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install the GitHub App">
    You'll be redirected to GitHub to install the Hiro GitHub App.

    Choose:
    - Which organization to install to
    - Which repositories to grant access (all or select)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Authorize">
    Click **Install** to authorize the app.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify connection">
    You'll be redirected back to Hiro with the connection confirmed.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Investigation Examples

### Check branch protection across repos

```
Which of our repositories don't have branch protection enabled?
```

Hiro checks all accessible repos and returns:
- Protected repos count
- Unprotected repos with visibility (public/private)
- Protection details for each protected repo
- Security recommendations

### Check specific repo

```
What are the branch protection rules for the api-server repo?
```

Returns:
- Required PR reviews (approval count, dismiss stale reviews)
- Status check requirements
- Admin enforcement
- Force push and deletion settings

### Query audit logs (Enterprise Cloud only)

```
Show me security-relevant GitHub events in the last 24 hours
```

Monitored events include:
- Branch protection changes (`protected_branch.destroy`, `protected_branch.policy_override`)
- Repository access changes (`repo.add_member`, `repo.remove_member`)
- Token and key creation (`personal_access_token.create`, `deploy_key.create`)
- Webhook changes (`hook.create`, `hook.config_changed`)
- Secret scanning alerts

## Branch Protection

### Enabling Protection

Hiro can enable basic branch protection:

```
PROPOSED ACTION: Enable Branch Protection
─────────────────────────────────────────
Repository: acme/api-server
Branch: main
Settings:
  • Require 1 PR review before merging
  • Dismiss stale reviews when new commits pushed
  • Enforce rules on admins
  • Prevent force pushes
  • Prevent branch deletion

[Approve]  [Reject]
```

<Warning>
This enables a standard protection configuration. For custom settings, configure directly in GitHub.
</Warning>

## Audit Log Access

Audit log queries require **GitHub Enterprise Cloud**. Standard GitHub plans don't expose the audit log API.

If you're on Enterprise Cloud, Hiro can search:
- By GitHub username
- By source IP address
- By action type
- By time range

## Troubleshooting

### "App not installed"

The GitHub App may need to be installed or reinstalled. Click **Connect to GitHub** again.

### "Repository not found"

The app may not have access to that repository. Check the app's repository access in GitHub settings.

### Audit log queries failing

Audit log access requires GitHub Enterprise Cloud. Standard GitHub plans don't have API access to audit logs.
