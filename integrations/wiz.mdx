The Wiz integration imports cloud security findings and enables deep linking for instant investigation of Wiz issues in Hiro.

## Capabilities

### Query Tools

| Tool | What It Does |
|------|--------------|
| **Import issues** | Fetch security issues from Wiz with severity and status filters |
| **Deep link investigation** | Instantly investigate a specific Wiz issue from a link |

### What Gets Imported

Hiro imports Wiz issues including:

- **Issue details** — ID, status, severity, timestamps
- **Resource info** — Cloud platform, region, resource type, tags
- **Project context** — Project name, owners, business unit, risk profile
- **Rule information** — Security controls, recommendations, compliance frameworks

### Action Tools

The Wiz integration is **read-only**. Hiro can query and analyze Wiz findings but cannot modify issues in Wiz.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Wiz account with API access
- Ability to create service accounts in Wiz

### Connection Steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a service account in Wiz">
    In the Wiz console:
    1. Go to **Settings > Service Accounts**
    2. Click **Create Service Account**
    3. Name it (e.g., "Hiro Integration")
    4. Grant read permissions for issues and projects
    5. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Note your API endpoints">
    Find your regional endpoints:

    | Region | API Endpoint | Auth Endpoint |
    |--------|--------------|---------------|
    | US | `https://api.us1.app.wiz.io/graphql` | `https://auth.app.wiz.io/oauth/token` |
    | EU | `https://api.eu1.app.wiz.io/graphql` | `https://auth.app.wiz.io/oauth/token` |
    | US Gov | `https://api.us2.app.wiz.io/graphql` | `https://auth.gov.wiz.io/oauth/token` |
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect in Hiro">
    In Hiro, go to [**Settings > Integrations**](https://app.hiro.is/settings/integrations):
    1. Click **Connect** next to Wiz
    2. Enter your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**
    3. Enter your **API Endpoint** and **Auth Endpoint**
    4. Click **Connect**
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Deep Linking

Wiz issues are automatically synced to Hiro as detections. Deep linking lets you jump directly from Wiz to the detection in Hiro.

### How It Works

1. Hiro automatically syncs Wiz issues as detections
2. From a Wiz issue, click the deep link to Hiro
3. You're taken directly to the detection in Hiro

### Deep Link Format

```
https://app.hiro.is/investigate/wiz?issue_id={wiz_issue_id}
```

Replace `{wiz_issue_id}` with the Wiz issue ID.

### Use Cases

- **Seamless workflow** — Click through from Wiz without switching context
- **Start investigating** — Open Chat or Fight Mode from the detection
- **Correlate findings** — Cross-reference with Okta, AWS, and other integrations

## Investigation Examples

### Analyze a Wiz finding

```
What's the risk of this Wiz finding? What resources are affected?
```

### Correlate with identity

```
Who has access to the affected resource? Check Okta and AWS.
```

### Check for related activity

```
Has anyone accessed this resource recently? Check CloudTrail.
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Authentication failed"

- Verify the Client ID and Client Secret are correct
- Check that the service account is still active in Wiz
- Ensure you're using the correct regional endpoints

### "Issue not found"

- The Wiz issue may have been resolved or deleted
- Verify the issue ID is correct
- Check that the service account has permission to view the issue

### Deep link not working

- Ensure the Wiz integration is connected in Hiro
- Verify the issue ID format is correct
- Check that you're logged into Hiro
