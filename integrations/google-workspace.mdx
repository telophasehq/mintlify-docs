The Google Workspace integration provides read-only visibility into users, groups, devices, and security events.

## Capabilities

### Query Tools

| Tool | What It Does |
|------|--------------|
| **Analyze user security** | Security posture analysis: 2FA coverage, admin accounts, recent users |
| **List users** | List users with status, admin flags, 2FA enrollment |
| **Get user details** | Detailed user info: status, 2FA, recovery info, aliases, last login |
| **List groups** | List all groups with member counts |
| **Get group members** | View members by role (owner, manager, member) |
| **Get login failures** | Recent failed login attempts grouped by user and IP |
| **List third-party apps** | OAuth apps connected to user accounts with permission analysis |
| **List org units** | Organizational unit hierarchy |

### What Hiro Cannot Do

<Warning>
Google Workspace integration is **read-only**. Hiro cannot take any actions.
</Warning>

- Cannot suspend or disable users
- Cannot wipe devices
- Cannot reset passwords
- Cannot revoke OAuth tokens
- Cannot modify group membership
- Cannot change any settings

All remediation must be done manually in the Google Workspace Admin Console.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Google Workspace admin access
- Business, Enterprise, or Education plan

### Connection Method

Hiro connects via **OAuth 2.0** with admin consent.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start connection">
    In Hiro, go to [**Settings > Integrations**](https://app.hiro.is/settings/integrations) and click **Connect**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Sign in with admin account">
    You'll be redirected to Google. Sign in with a Google Workspace admin account.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Grant permissions">
    Review and approve the requested permissions. All scopes are read-only:
    - Directory API (users, groups, org units, devices)
    - Reports API (login activity, admin activity, token activity)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify admin access">
    Hiro verifies your admin access by attempting to list users. If this fails, the connection will show a warning.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Investigation Examples

### Security posture analysis

```
Analyze our Google Workspace security posture
```

Returns:
- Total users (active, suspended, archived)
- Users without 2FA enabled
- Admin users and their 2FA status
- Recently created users (last 30 days)
- Security findings with severity levels

### Check a specific user

```
Get details for john@company.com in Google Workspace
```

Returns:
- Account status
- 2FA enrollment
- Last login time
- Admin privileges
- Email aliases
- Recovery information

### Find login failures

```
Show me failed login attempts in Google Workspace
```

Returns:
- Failed attempts grouped by user
- IP addresses used
- Recommendations for accounts with many failures

### Audit third-party apps

```
What third-party apps are connected to our Google Workspace?
```

Returns:
- Apps categorized by risk level:
  - **High risk**: Full email or Drive access
  - **Medium risk**: Calendar or contacts access
  - **Low risk**: Limited permissions
- Scopes/permissions for each app
- Number of users with each app

## Security Analysis

Hiro's security analysis highlights:

| Finding | Severity |
|---------|----------|
| Admin without 2FA | Critical |
| Many users without 2FA | High |
| Recently created admin accounts | High |
| High-risk third-party apps | Medium |

## Limitations

Since the integration is read-only:

1. **For user issues** — Suspend users manually in Admin Console, or use Okta if users are provisioned through Okta
2. **For device issues** — Wipe devices manually in Admin Console
3. **For app issues** — Revoke OAuth tokens manually in Admin Console

<Tip>
If you need to take action on Google Workspace users, consider provisioning users through Okta. Hiro can then suspend users via the Okta integration.
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting

### "Admin access not verified"

The account used to connect may not have sufficient admin privileges. Reconnect with a Super Admin account.

### Slow queries

Google Workspace APIs can be slow for large domains. Queries may take several seconds.

### Missing data

Some report data requires specific Google Workspace editions. Check your license level.
