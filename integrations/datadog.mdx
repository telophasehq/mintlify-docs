The Datadog integration provides log search and analysis capabilities, allowing Hiro to investigate security events across your application and infrastructure logs.

## Capabilities

### Query Tools

| Tool | What It Does |
|------|--------------|
| **Query logs** | Search logs by username, IP address, hostname, or custom query |
| **Correlate activity** | Cross-reference Datadog logs with other integrations |

### What You Can Search

Hiro can query Datadog logs with flexible filtering:

- **Usernames** — Filter by `@usr.name` field
- **IP addresses** — Filter by `@network.client.ip` field
- **Hostnames** — Filter by `host` field
- **Custom queries** — Full Datadog query syntax support

**Example queries:**

```
status:error AND service:auth-service
@http.status_code:>=400
host:web-* AND env:production
@usr.name:john.doe
```

### Action Tools

The Datadog integration is **read-only**. Hiro can query and analyze logs but cannot modify Datadog configuration, create monitors, or trigger alerts.

<Info>
Remediation actions based on Datadog findings are executed through other integrations (Okta, AWS, CrowdStrike, etc.).
</Info>

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Datadog account with log retention enabled
- Ability to create API and Application keys

### Connection Steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create an API key">
    In Datadog:
    1. Go to **Organization Settings > API Keys**
    2. Click **New Key**
    3. Name it (e.g., "Hiro Security")
    4. Copy the API key
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create an Application key">
    1. Go to **Organization Settings > Application Keys**
    2. Click **New Key**
    3. Name it (e.g., "Hiro Security")
    4. Copy the Application key
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect in Hiro">
    In Hiro, go to [**Settings > Integrations**](https://app.hiro.is/settings/integrations):
    1. Click **Connect** next to Datadog
    2. Enter your **API Key**
    3. Enter your **Application Key**
    4. Select your **Datadog site** (e.g., `datadoghq.com` for US1)
    5. Click **Connect**
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Datadog Sites

Select the site that matches your Datadog account:

| Site | URL |
|------|-----|
| US1 (default) | `datadoghq.com` |
| US3 | `us3.datadoghq.com` |
| US5 | `us5.datadoghq.com` |
| EU | `datadoghq.eu` |
| AP1 | `ap1.datadoghq.com` |
| US1-FED | `ddog-gov.com` |

## Investigation Examples

### Search for errors

```
Show me error logs from the auth service in the last hour
```

### Investigate a user

```
Find all Datadog logs related to john@company.com
```

### Search by IP

```
Show me logs from IP 185.220.101.1 across all services
```

### Correlate across systems

```
Correlate this user's activity across Datadog, Okta, and AWS
```

Hiro queries all connected integrations and builds a unified timeline.

## Troubleshooting

### "Authentication failed"

- Verify both the API Key and Application Key are correct
- Check that the keys haven't been revoked in Datadog
- Ensure you selected the correct Datadog site

### "No logs found"

- Verify log retention is enabled in your Datadog plan
- Check that relevant log sources are configured and indexed
- Try expanding the time range

### Rate limiting

Datadog has API rate limits. If you're hitting limits, try narrowing your search queries or reducing the time range.
