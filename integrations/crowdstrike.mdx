The CrowdStrike integration provides endpoint detection visibility and enables host containment for compromised endpoints.

## Capabilities

### Query Tools

| Tool | What It Does |
|------|--------------|
| **Query detections** | Search detections by IP, hostname, username, time range |
| **Correlate with AWS** | Find AWS sessions related to endpoint alerts |

### Action Tools

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Contain host | Network-isolate an endpoint (maintains CrowdStrike connection) |
| Lift containment | Restore network access to a contained host |
| Update alert status | Change detection status (new, in_progress, true_positive, false_positive, closed, ignored) |

<Warning>
All actions require explicit approval before execution.
</Warning>

### Detection Ingestion

Hiro automatically polls CrowdStrike for new detections and ingests them into the detection queue with:
- AI-generated summaries
- MITRE ATT&CK mapping
- Device, user, and process details
- Full raw detection data

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- CrowdStrike Falcon console access
- Ability to create API clients

### Connection Steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create API credentials">
    In the CrowdStrike console:
    1. Go to **Support > API Clients and Keys**
    2. Click **Add new API client**
    3. Grant these scopes:
       - **Detections**: Read
       - **Hosts**: Read, Write
       - **Alerts**: Read, Write
  </Step>
  <Step title="Copy credentials">
    Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect in Hiro">
    In Hiro, go to [**Settings > Integrations**](https://app.hiro.is/settings/integrations):
    1. Enter the Client ID
    2. Enter the Client Secret
    3. Enter the API base URL (e.g., `https://api.crowdstrike.com` or your regional URL)
    4. Click **Connect**
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Required API Scopes

| Scope | Permission | Purpose |
|-------|------------|---------|
| Detections | Read | Query detections |
| Hosts | Read | View endpoint information |
| Hosts | Write | Contain/uncontain hosts |
| Alerts | Read | View alert details |
| Alerts | Write | Update alert status |

## Host Containment

Containment isolates a compromised endpoint from the network while maintaining the CrowdStrike cloud connection for remote response.

### What Containment Does

- Blocks all network traffic except to CrowdStrike cloud
- Prevents lateral movement
- Maintains remote management capability
- Does NOT affect local processes

### Containment Workflow

```
PROPOSED ACTION: Contain Host (CrowdStrike)
───────────────────────────────────────────
Device ID: abc123def456
Hostname: LAPTOP-A1B2C3
Reason: Active ransomware detected
Evidence:
  • Detection: Ransomware.Generic (Critical severity)
  • File encryption activity at 14:32:15
  • Process: suspicious.exe spawned from email attachment
Confidence: High (96%)

[Approve]  [Reject]
```

After approval, the host is immediately network-isolated.

### Lifting Containment

When remediation is complete:

```
PROPOSED ACTION: Lift Containment (CrowdStrike)
───────────────────────────────────────────────
Device ID: abc123def456
Hostname: LAPTOP-A1B2C3
Reason: Remediation confirmed complete

[Approve]  [Reject]
```

## Investigation Examples

### Query detections

```
Show me CrowdStrike detections from the last 24 hours
```

### Check specific host

```
What detections have occurred on LAPTOP-A1B2C3?
```

### Correlate with identity

```
A user's Okta account was compromised. Check their endpoint for related activity.
```

Hiro correlates the user's identity with their CrowdStrike-monitored endpoints.

## Detection Status Management

Update detection status as you investigate:

| Status | Use When |
|--------|----------|
| `new` | Detection just received |
| `in_progress` | Actively investigating |
| `true_positive` | Confirmed threat |
| `false_positive` | Confirmed not a threat |
| `closed` | Investigation complete |
| `ignored` | Intentionally not investigating |

## Troubleshooting

### "Authentication failed"

- Verify Client ID and Client Secret are correct
- Check that the API client is enabled in CrowdStrike
- Verify the base URL matches your CrowdStrike region

### "Insufficient permissions"

The API client is missing required scopes. Create a new client with Detections (Read), Hosts (Read/Write), and Alerts (Read/Write).

### Containment failed

- The host may be offline
- The CrowdStrike agent may be outdated
- Check host status in the CrowdStrike console
