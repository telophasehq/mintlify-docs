The Chat interface is Hiro's primary investigation tool. Ask questions in plain English and Hiro automatically queries your security stack, correlates data, and presents actionable findings.

## How It Works

When you send a message, Hiro's AI agent:

1. **Parses your intent** — Understands what you're asking about
2. **Selects relevant tools** — Chooses which integrations to query
3. **Executes queries** — Fetches data from your security tools
4. **Analyzes results** — Identifies patterns and anomalies
5. **Responds with findings** — Presents information in natural language

<Info>
Hiro streams responses in real-time, so you can see the agent's progress as it works through your query.

## Starting a Conversation

Navigate to **Chat** in the left sidebar. You'll see the conversation interface with a text input at the bottom.

### What Can I Ask Hiro?

Hiro understands natural language queries across your entire security stack. Here are examples organized by use case:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="User Investigation">
    - What has john@company.com been doing in the last 24 hours?
    - Show me all activity for this user across Okta, AWS, and GitHub
    - When did this user last log in, and from where?
    - What applications does jane@company.com have access to?
    - Has this user's behavior changed recently?
    - List all users who accessed sensitive repos in the last week
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Suspicious Activity">
    - Show me all failed login attempts from IP 185.220.101.1
    - Which users logged in from countries we don't operate in?
    - Find logins from Tor exit nodes in the last 24 hours
    - Are there any impossible travel scenarios today?

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Identity & Access">
    - Which users in Okta have MFA disabled?
    - List all users with admin privileges

    - Who has permissions to modify security groups?
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Endpoint Security">
    - Show me CrowdStrike detections from the last 24 hours
    - Which endpoints have critical severity alerts?
    - What detections involve ransomware indicators?
    - Find all alerts related to this user's devices
    - Are there any contained hosts right now?
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Code & Repository">
    - Who accessed the infrastructure repo yesterday?
    - Show me commits to production branches after hours
    - Which external collaborators have repo access?
    - Find repos with secrets scanning alerts
    - What GitHub apps have access to our org?
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Incident Correlation">
    - Find all AWS activity from users who logged in from this IP
    - Correlate this Okta user with their CrowdStrike endpoints
    - What else did this access key do before it was compromised?
    - Show me all activity from this user across all systems
    - Connect this detection to related identity events
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Context and Follow-ups

Hiro maintains conversation context, allowing natural follow-up questions:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Initial Query">
    ```
    Show me failed logins in Okta from the last hour
    ```
    Hiro returns a list of failed login attempts with usernames, IPs, and timestamps.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Follow-up">
    ```
    Which of these users have admin privileges?
    ```
    Hiro correlates the previous results with user group memberships.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deeper Investigation">
    ```
    What other activity has the admin user performed today?
    ```
    Hiro expands the investigation to cover all activity from the identified admin.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Streaming Responses

Hiro's responses stream in real-time. As the agent works, you'll see:

- **Tool calls** — Which integrations are being queried
- **Intermediate results** — Data as it's retrieved
- **Analysis** — The agent's reasoning about the findings
- **Final summary** — Actionable conclusions

This transparency helps you understand how Hiro reached its conclusions and builds trust in the findings.

## Proposing Actions

When Hiro identifies a threat, it may propose remediation actions directly in the chat:

```
Based on my analysis, I recommend the following actions:

1. **Suspend user john.smith@company.com in Okta**
   - Reason: Multiple failed logins from known malicious IP
   - Confidence: High (85%)

2. **Clear all active sessions for this user**
   - Reason: Potential session hijacking
   - Confidence: Medium (70%)

Would you like me to proceed with these actions?
```

You can approve or reject each action, or ask for more information before deciding.

## Conversation History

All conversations are automatically saved. To access previous conversations:

1. Click the conversation selector in the top-left of the chat interface
2. Browse or search your conversation history
3. Click any conversation to resume it

<Tip>
Resume old conversations to continue investigations with full context preserved.
</Tip>

## Best Practices

### Be Specific with Timeframes

```
# Good
Show me logins from the last 24 hours

# Better
Show me logins between 2pm and 5pm yesterday UTC
```

### Provide Context When Available

```
# Good
Investigate user john@company.com

# Better
Investigate user john@company.com - they reported their laptop was stolen yesterday
```

### Use Follow-ups Instead of Repeating

```
# Instead of starting over
Show me all activity from john@company.com in AWS

# Use a follow-up
What about their AWS activity?
```

### Ask for Specific Formats

```
Show me failed logins grouped by source IP, sorted by count
```

## Integration with Fight Mode

For active incidents requiring continuous monitoring, you can escalate from Chat to Fight Mode:

```
This looks like an active attack. Start Fight Mode and continuously
monitor for activity from this IP and any users it has touched.
```

Hiro will transition to Fight Mode with the current investigation context preserved.
