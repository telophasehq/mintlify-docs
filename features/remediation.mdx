Hiro can propose and execute remediation actions across your connected integrations. All high-impact actions require explicit approval, ensuring you maintain full control over your security response.

## How Remediation Works

When Hiro identifies a threat, it:

1. **Analyzes the situation** — Correlates evidence from multiple sources
2. **Determines appropriate actions** — Based on threat type and severity
3. **Calculates confidence** — How certain it is the action is warranted
4. **Proposes the action** — Presents it for your review
5. **Awaits approval** — Executes only after you confirm
6. **Logs the result** — Maintains a complete audit trail

<Warning>
Hiro will never execute a destructive action without explicit approval. You always see what will happen before it happens.
</Warning>

## Approval Levels

Hiro uses a tiered approval system:

### No Approval Required

Read-only operations that don't modify state:

- Querying logs and events
- Listing users, groups, and resources
- Reading configuration
- Fetching audit trails

### Approval Required

Actions that modify state or could impact users require explicit approval before execution. Both Admin and Member roles can approve actions in Hiro.

## Available Actions by Integration

## Confidence Scores

Hiro provides confidence scores for proposed actions:

| Score | Meaning | Recommendation |
|-------|---------|----------------|
| **High (80%+)** | Strong evidence supports action | Review briefly, approve if appropriate |
| **Medium (50–80%)** | Reasonable evidence | Review carefully, consider alternatives |
| **Low (below 50%)** | Limited evidence | Investigate further before approving |

<Info>
Confidence scores are based on the quantity and quality of evidence, consistency across sources, and historical patterns.
</Info>

## The Approval Interface

When Hiro proposes an action, you'll see:

### Action Details

- **What**: The specific action to be taken
- **Target**: The affected user, resource, or system
- **Why**: Reason for the recommendation
- **Evidence**: Supporting findings with timestamps
- **Confidence**: How certain Hiro is
- **Impact**: What will happen when executed

### Available Responses

| Response | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| **Approve** | Execute the action immediately |
| **Reject** | Skip this action, continue investigation |
| **More Info** | Ask Hiro for additional context |
| **Defer** | Save for later review |

## Manual Instructions

When an integration doesn't support API-based remediation, Hiro provides manual instructions:

```
MANUAL ACTION REQUIRED
─────────────────────
Hiro cannot automatically suspend users in your Okta configuration.

To suspend john@company.com manually:
1. Log in to Okta Admin Console
2. Navigate to Directory > People
3. Search for "john@company.com"
4. Click the user, then Actions > Suspend
5. Confirm the suspension

Once complete, mark this action as done in Hiro.

[Mark as Complete]  [Need Help]
```

## Audit Trail

Every action (proposed, approved, rejected, executed) is logged:

```
ACTION AUDIT LOG
────────────────
2024-01-15 14:32:15 | PROPOSED | Suspend Okta user john@company.com
2024-01-15 14:32:45 | APPROVED | by admin@company.com
2024-01-15 14:32:46 | EXECUTED | Okta API returned success
2024-01-15 14:32:47 | VERIFIED | User status confirmed as SUSPENDED
```

Access the full audit trail in [**Settings > Audit Log**](https://app.hiro.is/settings/audit) or export from any Fight Mode session.

## Rollback and Recovery

Some actions support rollback:

| Action | Rollback |
|--------|----------|
| Suspend Okta user | Unsuspend user |
| Contain CrowdStrike host | Lift containment |
| Deactivate AWS access key | Reactivate key |
| Terminate EC2 instance | Not reversible |
| Delete IAM user | Not reversible |

<Warning>
Destructive actions (delete, terminate) cannot be rolled back. Hiro will warn you before proposing irreversible actions.
</Warning>

## Best Practices

### Review Evidence Before Approving

Even with high confidence, take a moment to understand why Hiro is recommending an action.

### Start with Reversible Actions

When possible, prefer suspending over deleting, containing over terminating.

### Document Your Decisions

Use the notes feature to record why you approved or rejected an action.

### Verify After Execution

Hiro verifies actions automatically, but you can also confirm manually.
