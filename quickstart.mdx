This guide walks you through connecting your first integration and running your first investigation with your AI Security Engineer.

## Prerequisites

- A Hiro account ([sign up here](https://app.hiro.is))
- Admin access to at least one supported integration (Okta, AWS, CrowdStrike, etc.)

## Step 1: Sign in and create your organization

<Steps>
  <Step title="Sign in to Hiro">
    Navigate to [app.hiro.is](https://app.hiro.is) and sign in with your SSO provider or email.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create your organization">
    If this is your first time, you'll be prompted to create an organization. This is where your integrations and team members will live.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 2: Connect your first integration

Hiro's power comes from deep integrations with your security stack. Let's connect Okta as an example.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Settings">
    Click on **Settings** in the left sidebar, then select **Integrations**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Okta">
    Find Okta in the list of available integrations and click **Connect**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Authorize access">
    You'll be redirected to Okta to authorize Hiro. Grant the requested permissions—Hiro needs read access to user logs and the ability to perform administrative actions for remediations.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify connection">
    Once connected, you'll see a green checkmark next to Okta in your integrations list.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
For detailed setup instructions for each integration, see the [Integrations](/integrations/overview) section.
</Tip>

<Info>
**Using a different identity provider?** The steps above use Okta as an example, but Hiro also integrates with [Google Workspace](/integrations/google-workspace) and [AWS](/integrations/aws). The connection process is similar—navigate to Settings > Integrations and follow the prompts.
</Info>

## Step 3: Run your first investigation

Now let's investigate a security event using Hiro's conversational interface.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Chat">
    Click **Chat** in the left sidebar to open Hiro's investigation interface.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Ask a question">
    Try a question like:

    ```
    Show me failed login attempts in Okta from the last 24 hours
    ```

    Hiro will automatically query your Okta logs, analyze the results, and present findings.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Follow up">
    Hiro maintains context, so you can ask follow-up questions:

    ```
    Which of these users have MFA disabled?
    ```

    Hiro will correlate the previous results with user MFA status.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 4: Try Fight Mode

Fight Mode is Hiro's continuous threat hunting capability. It's designed for active incident response.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start Fight Mode">
    Click **Fight Mode** in the left sidebar and then **New Session**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Describe the threat">
    Enter initial threat indicators, for example:

    ```
    Investigate suspicious activity from IP 185.220.101.1
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Watch Hiro hunt">
    Hiro will continuously scan your integrations for activity related to this IP:
    - Discovering new indicators (users, credentials, resources)
    - Reporting specific findings with timestamps
    - Proposing remediation actions
  </Step>
  <Step title="Approve actions">
    When Hiro proposes an action (like suspending a compromised user), review the details and click **Approve** to execute, or **Reject** to skip.
  </Step>
</Steps>
