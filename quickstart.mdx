## Goal

Connect Okta, ask Hiro a question, and see results.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Sign up">
    Go to [app.hiro.is](https://app.hiro.is) and create an account.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect Okta">
    Go to **Settings > Integrations**, click **Connect** next to Okta, and authorize access.

    <Info>

    </Info>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Ask a question">
    Open **Chat** and try:
    ```
    Show me failed login attempts from the last 24 hours
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Follow up">
    Hiro keeps context. Ask:
    ```
    Which of these users have MFA disabled?
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Try Fight Mode">
    For active threats, open **Fight Mode** and enter:
    ```
    Investigate suspicious activity from IP 185.220.101.1
    ```
    Hiro will continuously hunt and propose actions for your approval.
