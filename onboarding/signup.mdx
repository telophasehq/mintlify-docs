## Organization Roles

When you create an organization, you're assigned the **Admin** role. Hiro has two roles:

| Role | Permissions |
|------|-------------|
| **Admin** | Full access: manage integrations, invite users, configure SSO, approve actions, view audit logs |
| **Member** | Investigation access: use Chat and Fight Mode, view detections, approve actions |

Admins can invite team members and assign them either role.

## Joining an Existing Organization

If your company already uses Hiro:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Request an invite">
    Ask your Hiro admin to send you an invitation.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check your email">
    You'll receive an invitation email with a link to join.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click the link">
    The invitation link will sign you in automatically and add you to the organization.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Inviting Team Members

As an admin, you can invite others to your organization:

  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Invite">
