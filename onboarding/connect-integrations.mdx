Connect your security tools to give Hiro the visibility it needs to investigate threats and take action.

## Why Connect Integrations?

Hiro's power comes from its ability to query and correlate data across your entire security stack. Each integration provides:

- **Query tools** — Read-only access to investigate threats
- **Action tools** — Remediation capabilities (with your approval)
- **Context** — Enriches investigations with relevant data

The more integrations you connect, the more effective Hiro becomes at finding and responding to threats.

## Quick Start: Connect Your First Integration

We recommend starting with your identity provider (Okta or Google Workspace), as identity is central to most security investigations.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Integrations">
    In Hiro, navigate to [**Settings > Integrations**](https://app.hiro.is/settings/integrations).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select an integration">
    Click **Connect** next to the integration you want to add.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Authorize access">
    Follow the OAuth flow or enter credentials as required.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify connection">
    Hiro will test the connection and show a success message.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Available Integrations

### Identity & Access

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Okta" icon="key" href="/integrations/okta">
    **Recommended first integration**

    User authentication, SSO, and lifecycle management. Query login events, check MFA status, suspend compromised users.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Google Workspace" icon="google" href="/integrations/google-workspace">
    Enterprise productivity suite. View user activity, audit devices, investigate security events.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Cloud Infrastructure

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="AWS" icon="cloud" href="/integrations/aws">
    CloudTrail, IAM, EC2, and GuardDuty. Investigate API activity, analyze permissions, respond to cloud threats.
  </Card>

## Recommended Integration Order

For the best experience, we recommend connecting integrations in this order:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Identity provider (Okta or Google Workspace)">
    **Why first**: Identity is the foundation of security investigations. Most threats involve compromised users, and Hiro needs to understand who your users are.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Cloud infrastructure (AWS)">
    **Why second**: Cloud environments are common targets. CloudTrail provides rich API logs that Hiro correlates with identity data.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Endpoint protection (CrowdStrike)">
    **Why third**: Endpoint detections are often the first sign of compromise. Connecting CrowdStrike lets Hiro automatically investigate and respond to alerts.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Source code (GitHub)">
    **Why fourth**: Supply chain and code security is increasingly important. GitHub audit logs reveal access patterns and potential exposure.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Communication (Slack)">
    **Why last**: Slack enables Hiro to contact users for verification during investigations—helpful but not required for core functionality.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Permissions and Access

Each integration requires specific permissions. Hiro follows the principle of least privilege—we only request what's needed.

### Read vs. Write Permissions

| Permission Type | Purpose | Required? |
|----------------|---------|-----------|
| **Read** | Query logs, list users, view configuration | Yes |
| **Write** | Suspend users, revoke access, contain hosts | Optional |

<Info>
Write permissions are optional. Without them, Hiro can investigate threats but will provide manual instructions for remediation instead of executing actions directly.
</Info>

### What Hiro Can Access

When you connect an integration, Hiro can:

- Query logs and events on-demand during investigations
- List users, groups, and resources
- Read configuration and policies
- (With write permissions) Execute approved remediation actions

Hiro does **not**:
- Store your raw logs permanently (except detection snapshots)
- Access data outside of investigations
- Make changes without your explicit approval

## Managing Integrations

### View Integration Status

Go to [**Settings > Integrations**](https://app.hiro.is/settings/integrations) to see all connected integrations and their status:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Connected** | Working normally |
| **Error** | Connection issue—click for details |
| **Expired** | OAuth token needs refresh |

### Refresh Credentials

If an integration shows an error or expired status:

1. Click on the integration
2. Click **Reconnect**
3. Complete the authorization flow again

### Disconnect an Integration

To remove an integration:

1. Go to [**Settings > Integrations**](https://app.hiro.is/settings/integrations)
2. Click on the integration
3. Click **Disconnect**
4. Confirm the disconnection

<Warning>
Disconnecting an integration immediately revokes Hiro's access. Active investigations using that integration will show errors until it's reconnected.
</Warning>

## Multi-Account Support

### AWS

Deploy Hiro's CloudFormation template to each AWS account:

1. Download the template from [**Settings > Integrations**](https://app.hiro.is/settings/integrations)
2. Deploy to each account you want to monitor
3. Add each Role ARN to Hiro

### Multiple Okta Organizations

Connect multiple Okta orgs by clicking **Add Another** after connecting the first one.

### Multiple GitHub Organizations

The Hiro GitHub App can be installed in multiple organizations. Each installation is tracked separately.

## Troubleshooting

### "Authorization Failed"

- Ensure you have admin permissions in the target system
- Check that API access is enabled (some organizations restrict this)
- Verify you're authorizing the correct account

### "Connection Test Failed"

- The credentials may have expired—try reconnecting
- Check if there are IP restrictions on API access
- Verify the integration hasn't been disabled on the provider side

### "Insufficient Permissions"

- The account used to connect may not have required permissions
- Some actions require elevated privileges (e.g., Super Admin in Okta)
- Check the integration's documentation for required permissions

### Need Help?

Contact support@hiro.is with:
- The integration you're trying to connect
- Any error messages you're seeing
- Screenshots of the issue
